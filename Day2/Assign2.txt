The primary limitation of my solution is that it can only accommodate for the types I have specifically designated, using the input string's contents to pick between a set of sizeof commands that actually measure the size. It is barely better than just posting a table of type sizes as it does check the size as implemented on the specific system running it.

While I have very little direct experience with other languages, it is my understanding that some, particularly scripting languages, can often convert text strings to actual instructions (similar to the "echo`<instruction>` in Bash). This would allow for the program to do something along the lines of sizeof(<user_input>) directly rather than the indirect method I implemented. This would be much more flexible, but also significantly more prone to undefined or unexpected behavior.
