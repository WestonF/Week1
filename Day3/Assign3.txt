The only times I would choose to use an array instead of a vector is if performance or memory were at an extreme premium, or if specifically instructed to do so.
Vectors provide increased access safety when using .at, are easily added to through .push_back, and provide member functions for inserting or deleting sections of the contents while retaining element adjacency rather than having to manually clear and re-position values.
The advantage of a vector is most noticiable when interacting with an uncertain number of data elements, as vectors can dynamically increase in size and capacity while an array must have its capacity defined at compile time. If it is found that more values are required than the initially designated capacity, there is no easy solution with an array outside of adjusting the source code, while a vector will simply expand and/or move itself and contents to a new location where sufficient space is available.
